# you prefer, you can also configure qutebrowser using the
# :set/:bind/:config-* commands without having to write a config.py
# file.

# Which method of blocking ads should be used.  Support for Adblock Plus
# (ABP) syntax blocklists using Brave's Rust library requires the
# `adblock` Python package to be installed, which is an optional
# dependency of qutebrowser. It is required when either `adblock` or
# `both` are selected.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - auto: Use Brave's ABP-style adblocker if available, host blocking otherwise
#   - adblock: Use Brave's ABP-style adblocker
#   - hosts: Use hosts blocking
#   - both: Use both hosts blocking and Brave's ABP-style adblocker

# When to show the statusbar.
# Type: String

#   - always: Always show the statusbar.
#   - never: Always hide the statusbar.
#   - in-mode: Show the statusbar when in modes other than normal mode.

# When to show the tab bar.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - always: Always show the tab bar.

#   - switching: Show the tab bar when switching tabs.

# Search engines which can be used via the address bar.  Maps a search
# engine name (such as `DEFAULT`, or `ddg`) to a URL with a `{}`
# placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term, use
# `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` braces.  The following further
# placeholds are defined to configure how special characters in the
# search terms are replaced by safe characters (called 'quoting'):  *
# `{}` and `{semiquoted}` quote everything except slashes; this is the
# most   sensible choice for almost all search engines (for the search
# term   `slash/and&amp` this placeholder expands to `slash/and%26amp`).
# * `{quoted}` quotes all characters (for `slash/and&amp` this
# placeholder   expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`). * `{unquoted}` quotes
# nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder   expands to
# `slash/and&amp`). * `{0}` means the same as `{}`, but can be used
# multiple times.  The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when
# `url.auto_search` is turned on and something else than a URL was
# entered to be opened. Other search engines can be used by prepending
# the search engine name to the search term, e.g. `:open google
# qutebrowser`.
# Type: Dict

## Editor (and arguments) to use for the `edit-*` commands. The following
## placeholders are defined:  * `{file}`: Filename of the file to be
## edited. * `{line}`: Line in which the caret is found in the text. *
## `{column}`: Column in which the caret is found in the text. *
## `{line0}`: Same as `{line}`, but starting from index 0. * `{column0}`:
## Same as `{column}`, but starting from index 0.
## Type: ShellCommand
c.editor.command = ['kitty', 'nvim', '+call cursor({line},{column})', '{file}']

## Allow JavaScript to read from or write to the clipboard. With

## is always allowed.

##   - access-paste: Allow accessing the clipboard and pasting clipboard content.

## Which algorithm to use for modifying how colors are rendered with
## darkmode. The `lightness-cielab` value was added with QtWebEngine 5.14
## and is treated like `lightness-hsl` with older QtWebEngine versions.
## Type: String
## Valid values:
##   - lightness-cielab: Modify colors by converting them to CIELAB color space and inverting the L value. Not available with Qt < 5.14.
##   - lightness-hsl: Modify colors by converting them to the HSL color space and inverting the lightness (i.e. the "L" in HSL).
##   - brightness-rgb: Modify colors by subtracting each of r, g, and b from their maximum value.
c.colors.webpage.darkmode.algorithm = 'lightness-hsl'

## Render all web contents using a dark theme. Example configurations
## from Chromium's `chrome://flags`: - "With simple HSL/CIELAB/RGB-based
## inversion": Set   `colors.webpage.darkmode.algorithm` accordingly, and
## set `colors.webpage.darkmode.policy.images` to `never`.  - "With
## selective image inversion": qutebrowser default settings.

# value is only available with QtWebEngine 5.15.2+. On older versions,
# it is the same as "auto". The "auto" value is broken on QtWebEngine
# 5.15.2 due to a Qt bug. There, it will fall back to "light"
# unconditionally.
# Type: String

#   - dark: Force a dark theme.
